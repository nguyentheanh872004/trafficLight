This is a topic using the STM32F406VET to program a traffic light simulation, with different modes controlled via a 4x4 matrix keyboard.

- If you press A, the entire system stops.

- Press B, the yellow light flashes.

- Press C to enter traffic light adjustment mode (press the yellow and green light times, then the red light will be equal to the total time of the other two lights).
